# TODO - The Unfinished Grimoire

> *"Even perfection can be improved upon - such is the nature of excess."*

## Banishment Rites

- [ ] Create "uninstall" ritual which removes all trace of every little thing that was installed - a complete purification that leaves no remnant of Slaane.sh's corruption

## Python Offerings

- [ ] Add python modules and tools from the sacred libraries:
  - [ ] rich-cli - Terminal output that pleases even the most obsessive
  - [ ] rich - The Python library for rich text and beautiful formatting (foundation of rich-cli)
  - [ ] bpytop - System monitoring worthy of the Adeptus Mechanicus
  - [ ] toolong - Command-line tools for the initiated
  - [ ] (additional offerings to be catalogued)
